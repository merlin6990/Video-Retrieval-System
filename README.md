## Information about the dataset
The total video time is 176 hours with an average length of 5.26 mins for each video. Each video captured is within 10 mins and is recorded by camera devices but not slideshows. All the videos and precomputed feature can be downloaded in the Download page.
Each video contains some number of procedure steps to fulfill a recipe. All the procedure segments are temporal localized in the video with starting time and ending time. The distributions of 1) video duration, 2) number of recipe steps per video, 3) recipe segment duration and 4) number of words per sentence are shown below
